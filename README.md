## What is cmdr?

cmdr is a directory of frequently used commands in software development, categorized across different technologies.

## Running locally

Once the repo is cloned to your local device, you can run:

```sh
yarn install
yarn dev

```

cmdr will start running immediately.

## Contributing

All the commands are stored inside the project in a YAML file which acts as the current database. A new command can be easily to the system added by altering the YAML file and sending a pull request.
