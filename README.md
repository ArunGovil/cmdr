## What is cmdr?

cmdr is a directory of frequently used commands in daily software development, categorized across different technologies.

## How do I add a command?

Commands are stored inside the content folder in a JSON file which acts as the current database. You can add new commands by following by following these steps:

- Fork the repository.
- Add a new command at the end of `content/content.json` file.
- Submit a PR.

> **Note** Please follow the below format, and make sure you are not creating multiple copies of same command.

```json
{
  "title": "<COMMAND TITLE>",
  "code": "<COMMAND CODE>",
  "technology": "<CORE TECHNOLOGY>",
  "tags": ["<TAG ONE>", "<TAG TWO>"]
}
```

## Running locally

Once the repo is cloned to your local device, you can run:

```sh
yarn install
yarn dev

```

cmdr will start running immediately.
